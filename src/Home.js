    <h2>The purpose of our lives is to be happy</h2>
    <p>Life brings us as many joyful moments as it does downfalls, and although there are days we wish there was a manual to follow, it simply wouldn’t be the same without the spontaneity. The journey of life may not become easier as we grow older, but we do seem to understand it better as our perspectives evolve. Whether you’re embarking on a new adventure right out of school or you want to explore different paths in your personal life, it’s never too late to change what the future looks like.</p>
    <p>If you’re in need of motivation and inspiration, these life quotes from Hoda Kotb, Meghan Markle, Reese Witherspoon, among others, are exactly what you need to hear. Advice from practicing self-love to having a sense of humor to being optimistic never grows old and will surely help you find the push you need to get where you’re going.</p>
     <p>“Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven’t found it yet, keep looking. Don’t settle. As with all matters of the heart, you’ll know when you find it.” — Steve Jobs</p>
